        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This web app is developed as a case study/project by Kartik Shukla & Yuvraj from Delhi. It is designed for coaching institutes to manage student payments and statuses easily. You can use it anywhere on any screen. The app is fast, secure, and powered by Firebase.</p>
        <p>This document guides you through different pages of the app: Add, Dashboard, Search/Edit, Analysis, and additional info. Custom functionality can be added as per your need. If you want a version tailored for your coaching, contact us at white.devil.94484@gmail.com.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Add Page</h2>
        <p>This page is used to add a student entry into the database. Once added, the student data appears on other pages. Entries can later be edited or deleted from the Search/Edit or Dashboard sections. The form layout is customizable as per your needs - and functional customizations are free.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Dashboard Page</h2>
        <p>The dashboard shows all students filtered into categories: demo, paid, and unpaid. You can manually update statuses, or let the system auto-update them based on server time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demo to Paid alert after 2 days</li>
            <li>Paid to Unpaid if the last payment is older than 31 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notifications and reminders are displayed to ensure no status is missed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Search/Edit Page</h2>
        <p>Use this page to search or edit student entries. Filtering supports smart parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name search is partial (e.g., 'art' matches Kartik, Aryan)</li>
            <li>Fee-based filters using logical operators (e.g., '>800')</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also edit or delete any entry here.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Analysis Page</h2>
        <p>View custom visual analysis such as bar graphs or pie charts. Pre-built examples are included.</p>
        <p>Track student categories, payment trends, and more - no manual counting needed. Additional graph types and custom filters can be added on request.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Some More Important Info</h2>
        <p>This project uses Firebase's free Spark Plan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes (Firestore)</li>
            <li>1 GB storage, 10 GB network bandwidth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Firestore is structured and good for complex filtering. Realtime DB is better for light, real-time operations. Optimizing queries is important to avoid exceeding free limits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a team of two developers - Kartik (Database + JS) and Yuvraj (CSS, HTML, JS). We've worked on various real-world and demo projects. If you're here, you were likely referred by us. This app is a working case study and can be customized for your institution.</p>
